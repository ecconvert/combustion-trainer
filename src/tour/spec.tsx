        <p>
          This guided tour will teach you how to safely start up and tune a boiler for optimal efficiency. 
          You'll learn the proper startup sequence, tuning procedures, and data collection methods.

          <strong>Always start by selecting your fuel type first!</strong> Each fuel 
          (Natural Gas, Propane, Fuel Oil #2) has different combustion characteristics 
          and safety requirements.
        </p>
        <p>Choose your fuel to establish the baseline parameters.</p>

          turn on the boiler power so you can see the complete startup sequence.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>Programmer (EP160)</strong> panel shows the current burner state and controls the startup sequence. 
          This is your "brain" of the boiler system.

        <p>
          Once the programmer shows <code>RUN_AUTO</code>, you can safely adjust the firing rate. 
          Start low (around 30%) for initial tuning, then work up to higher rates.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Always tune at multiple firing rates (30% and 70%).</p>

          will measure O<sub>‚ÇÇ</sub>, CO, CO<sub>af</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub> levels.

          typically require different fuel/air ratios for optimal efficiency.
