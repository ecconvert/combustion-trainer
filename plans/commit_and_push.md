# Feature Implementation Plan: Commit and Push Changes


## 📋 Todo Checklist
- [ ] Create a new branch
- [ ] Stage all changes
- [ ] Commit the changes
- [ ] Push the new branch to the remote repository
- [ ] Final Review and Testing

## 🔍 Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
I have identified the following modified files:
- `e2e/tour-fast-forward.spec.ts`
- `e2e/utils.ts`
- `src/tour/JoyrideHost.tsx`

### Current Architecture
The current branch is `feat/tour-fast-forward-startup`. I will create a new branch to house these changes.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
This is a standard git workflow, so there are no external dependencies.

### Considerations & Challenges
There are no significant challenges with this task. I will need to ensure that the new branch is pushed to the remote repository.

## 📝 Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to push to the remote repository.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Create a new branch**:
   - Command: `git checkout -b feat/commit-and-push`

2. **Stage all changes**:
   - Command: `git add .`

3. **Commit the changes**:
   - Command: `git commit -m "feat: commit and push changes"`

4. **Push the new branch to the remote repository**:
   - Command: `git push -u origin feat/commit-and-push`

### Testing Strategy
After pushing the branch, I will verify that the branch is available on the remote repository.

## 🎯 Success Criteria
The new branch will be successfully pushed to the remote repository with all the changes.
