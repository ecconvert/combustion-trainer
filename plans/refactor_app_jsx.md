## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
- `src/App.jsx`: Currently serves as the main application component, handling routing, global state management via `UIStateContext`, and rendering various UI sections like `WelcomeSplash`, `RightDrawer`, `SettingsMenu`, and `PanelShell`. It also integrates `JoyrideHost` for guided tours.
- `src/main.jsx`: The application's entry point, responsible for rendering `App.jsx` wrapped in `UIStateContext.Provider`.
- `src/panels.jsx`: Defines the configuration and structure of different UI panels within the application.
- `src/layout/panels.jsx`: Likely handles the layout and rendering logic for the panels defined in `src/panels.jsx`.
- `src/components/`: Contains various reusable UI components.
- `src/layout/`: Contains components related to overall application layout.

### Current Architecture
The application is built with React, with `App.jsx` acting as the root component. It orchestrates the rendering of different parts of the UI and manages global state using React's Context API (`UIStateContext`). The project follows a component-based architecture, with UI elements and layout components separated into dedicated directories.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
- **React**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **`UIStateContext`**: A custom React Context for managing and providing global UI state to various components.
- **`JoyrideHost`**: A third-party library or custom component used for implementing guided tours or onboarding flows.
- **Custom Components**: `App.jsx` integrates numerous custom components from `src/components` and `src/layout`, such as `WelcomeSplash`, `RightDrawer`, `SettingsMenu`, and `PanelShell`.
- **`panels` object**: The `panels` object (from `src/panels.jsx`) is a critical data structure that dictates the configuration and content of the application's various UI panels. Its integration point is primarily within components responsible for rendering these panels.

### Considerations & Challenges
- **Monolithic `App.jsx`**: The primary challenge is the current monolithic nature of `App.jsx`, which combines too many responsibilities (routing, state management, rendering diverse UI sections). This makes the file difficult to read, understand, maintain, and test.
- **State Management Refinement**: While `UIStateContext` is in use, the refactoring provides an opportunity to re-evaluate and potentially optimize how state is managed and propagated, ensuring that only relevant state is passed to each new component.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The refactoring must prioritize a clear separation of concerns, extracting distinct logical blocks into their own, highly focused components. This will improve modularity and reusability.
- **Impact on Existing Features**: Care must be taken to ensure that the refactoring does not introduce regressions or break existing functionality, particularly the guided tour (`JoyrideHost`) and the dynamic rendering of panels.
- **Testing Strategy**: Existing unit and E2E tests that interact with `App.jsx` or its direct children may need to be updated. New tests should be considered for any newly created components to ensure their isolated functionality.

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- A clear understanding of the current `App.jsx` functionality and its interactions with other components and contexts.
- Access to the project's development environment and necessary dependencies installed.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  **Create a new `AppLayout` component**
    -   **Description**: This component will encapsulate the main layout structure of the application, including the `RightDrawer`, `SettingsMenu`, and the main content area where panels are rendered. It will receive necessary props from `App.jsx`.
    -   Files to modify: `src/layout/AppLayout.jsx` (new file)
    -   Changes needed: Move the core layout JSX from `App.jsx` into this new component. Define props for dynamic content (e.g., `children` for panels, props for drawer/menu visibility).

2.  **Extract `WelcomeSplash` logic into its own component**
    -   **Description**: If `WelcomeSplash` has significant rendering logic or state, it should be managed more directly within its own component, potentially receiving props for its visibility and actions.
    -   Files to modify: `src/components/WelcomeSplashContainer.jsx` (new file, if not already a standalone component)
    -   Changes needed: Ensure `WelcomeSplash` is rendered conditionally based on state, and its state management is self-contained or clearly passed via props.

3.  **Refactor Panel Rendering into a dedicated component**
    -   **Description**: The logic for iterating through `panels` and rendering `PanelShell` components can be extracted into a `PanelRenderer` or `MainContent` component.
    -   Files to modify: `src/layout/PanelRenderer.jsx` (new file)
    -   Changes needed: Move the mapping and rendering of `PanelShell` components from `App.jsx` into `PanelRenderer.jsx`. This component will likely need access to the `panels` data and potentially `UIStateContext` values.

4.  **Integrate `JoyrideHost` into a dedicated Tour component**
    -   **Description**: The `JoyrideHost` and its associated tour steps/logic can be moved into a `AppTour` component, which `App.jsx` will then render.
    -   Files to modify: `src/tour/AppTour.jsx` (new file)
    -   Changes needed: Move `JoyrideHost` and any tour-specific state or effects from `App.jsx` to `AppTour.jsx`. `AppTour` will manage the tour's lifecycle.

5.  **Update `App.jsx` to use the new components**
    -   **Description**: Modify `App.jsx` to import and render the newly created `AppLayout`, `WelcomeSplashContainer`, `PanelRenderer`, and `AppTour` components.
    -   Files to modify: `src/App.jsx`
    -   Changes needed: Remove the extracted JSX and logic. Replace with imports and rendering of the new components, passing down only the necessary props.

6.  **Adjust `UIStateContext` usage (if necessary)**
    -   **Description**: Review how state is consumed by the new components. Ensure that `UIStateContext` is used efficiently and that components only subscribe to the state they need.
    -   Files to modify: `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/UIStateContext.jsx`, and new components.
    -   Changes needed: Potentially adjust context providers/consumers or introduce custom hooks for specific state slices if it improves performance or readability.

7.  **Update imports in related files**
    -   **Description**: Any files that directly imported components or logic that were moved out of `App.jsx` will need their import paths updated.
    -   Files to modify: (To be determined during refactoring, e.g., `src/main.jsx` if `App.jsx`'s direct children change significantly).
    -   Changes needed: Update import statements to reflect new file locations.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Create or update unit tests for each new component (`AppLayout`, `PanelRenderer`, `AppTour`, etc.) to ensure their individual functionality and rendering are correct.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify that the newly composed `App.jsx` correctly integrates all the new components and that data flows as expected between them.
- **E2E Tests**: Run existing end-to-end tests (e.g., `e2e/smoke.spec.ts`, `e2e/tour.spec.ts`, `e2e/tuning-flow.spec.ts`) to ensure that critical user flows and features remain functional after the refactoring. Pay special attention to the tour functionality and panel interactions.
- **Manual Testing**: Perform a thorough manual review of the application to ensure all UI elements render correctly, interactions work as expected, and no visual regressions have been introduced.

## üéØ Success Criteria
- `App.jsx` is significantly smaller and more focused, primarily acting as an orchestrator for higher-level components.
- New components are created with clear responsibilities and are easily testable in isolation.
- The application's functionality, including all existing features (panels, settings, tours, etc.), remains unchanged and works as expected.
- Code readability and maintainability are demonstrably improved.
- All existing tests pass, and new tests are in place for the extracted components.
