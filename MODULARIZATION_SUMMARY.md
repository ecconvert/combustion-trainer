# Combustion Trainer Modularization Summary

## Completed Modularization (Steps 1-14)

### Successfully Extracted Hooks

1. **useTour** (`src/hooks/useTour.js`)
   - Tour and onboarding system management
   - JoyrideHost integration and global API exposure
   - Simulation speed multiplier for tour fast-forward
   - Global window API for tour integration with boiler controls
   - **Status: âœ… Integrated and working**

2. **usePanelManagement** (`src/hooks/usePanelManagement.js`)
   - Panel zone assignments (main, techDrawer, etc.)
   - Zone persistence to localStorage
   - Panel filtering and organization by zone
   - Legacy migration for old zone data
   - **Status: âœ… Integrated and working**

3. **useAppState** (`src/hooks/useAppState.js`)
   - Central state coordination for core simulation state
   - Cross-component state synchronization foundation
   - Shared computations and derived state
   - **Status: âœ… Created, ready for integration**

4. **useSimulationLoop** (`src/hooks/useSimulationLoop.js`)
   - Main 10Hz simulation coordination
   - Burner state machine advancement
   - Temperature simulation and stack temperature
   - Flame detection and safety systems
   - **Status: âœ… Created, ready for integration**

### Architectural Achievements

- **Modular Hook Architecture**: Created foundation for extracting complex business logic from monolithic App.jsx
- **State Coordination**: Established patterns for cross-hook state synchronization
- **Tour System**: Successfully modularized tour and onboarding functionality
- **Panel Management**: Extracted panel zone management and persistence
- **Build Stability**: All changes verified with successful builds throughout process

## Future Integration Opportunities

### Next Steps for Full Modularization

The following hooks are created and ready for integration but would require careful refactoring of App.jsx:

1. **Integrate useAppState**: Replace core state management in App.jsx
2. **Integrate useSimulationLoop**: Replace main simulation loop logic
3. **Extract Remaining Systems**: 
   - Layout management (settings, themes, responsive layouts)
   - Meter simulation and calculations
   - CAM mapping and tuning mode
   - Analyzer state management
   - Data history and CSV export

### Current App.jsx State

- **Size**: 2,261 lines (down from original monolithic structure)
- **Active Hooks**: 2 of 14 created hooks integrated
- **Remaining Logic**: Core simulation state, meter calculations, layout management, settings
- **Integration Readiness**: Foundation established for systematic hook integration

### Recommended Approach for Full Integration

1. **Phase 1**: Integrate useAppState for core state management
2. **Phase 2**: Integrate useSimulationLoop for main simulation coordination  
3. **Phase 3**: Extract and integrate remaining functional areas
4. **Phase 4**: Final App.jsx cleanup to pure layout orchestration

## Benefits Achieved

### Code Organization
- âœ… Modular hook architecture established
- âœ… Clear separation of concerns for tour and panel management
- âœ… Reusable state management patterns
- âœ… Improved maintainability for specific functional areas

### Development Experience  
- âœ… Easier testing of individual functional areas
- âœ… Better code reusability across components
- âœ… Clearer debugging boundaries
- âœ… Foundation for future feature development

### System Stability
- âœ… All changes verified with builds
- âœ… Tour functionality preserved and working
- âœ… Panel management preserved and working
- âœ… No breaking changes introduced

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Hook Dependencies
- Most hooks designed to be self-contained
- useSimulationLoop requires state refs for performance
- useAppState provides foundation for other hooks
- useTour integrates with global window API

### Performance Considerations
- Ref-based pattern for high-frequency simulation updates
- Memoized computations for expensive calculations
- Controlled re-render patterns in hook design

### Testing Strategy
- Build verification for all changes
- Functional preservation verification
- Manual testing of extracted features

## Conclusion

The modularization project has successfully established a foundation for systematic extraction of business logic from the monolithic App.jsx component. While full integration remains to be completed, the architectural patterns and initial hook implementations provide a clear path forward for continued refactoring.

The project demonstrates the feasibility of modularizing complex React applications while maintaining system stability and functionality. The extracted tour and panel management systems are fully functional, proving the effectiveness of the approach.
