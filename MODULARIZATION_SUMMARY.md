## Phase 2 Integration Plan

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED** - Detailed implementation plan created

### Phase 2 Objectives

- Integrate `useAppState` for centralized core state management
- Integrate `useSimulationLoop` for 10Hz simulation coordination
- Extract settings and theme management into `useSettings`
- Extract layout management into `useLayoutManager`
- Reduce App.jsx from 2,261 lines to ~800-1000 lines
- Maintain full system functionality and performance

### Phase 2 Implementation Strategy

**Sequential Integration Approach**:

1. **Step 1: useAppState Integration** (~4 hours)

   - Replace scattered useState declarations with centralized hook
   - Extract core simulation state, burner state, analyzer state
   - Replace individual refs with hook-provided performance refs
   - Update derived computations to use hook values

2. **Step 2: useSimulationLoop Integration** (~4 hours)

   - Replace main 10Hz simulation useEffect with hook coordination
   - Extract burner state machine, temperature simulation, flame detection
   - Maintain fast-forward functionality and timing accuracy
   - Remove legacy simulation functions and constants

3. **Step 3: Settings System Integration** (~3 hours)

   - Extract settings state, theme management, configuration handling
   - Replace settings handlers with hook-provided functions
   - Maintain settings persistence and live preview functionality

4. **Step 4: Layout Management Integration** (~3 hours)
   - Extract responsive grid layout state and handlers
   - Replace layout functions with hook-provided management
   - Maintain drag/resize functionality and layout persistence

### Detailed Documentation

- **PHASE_2_PLAN.md**: Comprehensive integration strategy and timeline
- **PHASE_2_INTEGRATION_COMMENTS.md**: Comment-first structure following Clean Code principles
- **PHASE_2_CHECKLIST.md**: Step-by-step implementation checklist with validation criteria

### Expected Outcomes

- **App.jsx Reduction**: ~800-900 lines removed (from 2,261 to ~1,300-1,400)
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between business logic (hooks) and presentation
- **Performance**: Maintained 10Hz simulation timing with ref-based optimizations
- **Maintainability**: Modular hook architecture with clear responsibilities
- **Foundation**: Ready for Phase 3 specialized system extraction

## Future Integration Opportunities

### Next Steps for Full Modularization

The following hooks are created and ready for integration but would require careful refactoring of App.jsx:

1. **Integrate useAppState**: Replace core state management in App.jsx
2. **Integrate useSimulationLoop**: Replace main simulation loop logic
3. **Extract Remaining Systems**:
   - Layout management (settings, themes, responsive layouts)
   - Meter simulation and calculations
   - CAM mapping and tuning mode
   - Analyzer state management
   - Data history and CSV export

### Current App.jsx State

- **Size**: 2,261 lines (down from original monolithic structure)
- **Active Hooks**: 2 of 14 created hooks integrated
- **Remaining Logic**: Core simulation state, meter calculations, layout management, settings
- **Integration Readiness**: Foundation established for systematic hook integration

### Recommended Approach for Full Integration

1. **Phase 1**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Foundation established with useTour and usePanelManagement
2. **Phase 2**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED** - Core state and simulation integration (see PHASE_2_PLAN.md)
   - Step 1: Integrate useAppState for centralized state management
   - Step 2: Integrate useSimulationLoop for 10Hz simulation coordination
   - Step 3: Extract settings and theme management
   - Step 4: Extract layout management
3. **Phase 3**: Extract and integrate remaining specialized systems
4. **Phase 4**: Final App.jsx cleanup to pure layout orchestration

## Benefits Achieved

### Code Organization

- âœ… Modular hook architecture established
- âœ… Clear separation of concerns for tour and panel management
- âœ… Reusable state management patterns
- âœ… Improved maintainability for specific functional areas

### Development Experience

- âœ… Easier testing of individual functional areas
- âœ… Better code reusability across components
- âœ… Clearer debugging boundaries
- âœ… Foundation for future feature development

### System Stability

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Hook Dependencies

- Most hooks designed to be self-contained
- useSimulationLoop requires state refs for performance
- useAppState provides foundation for other hooks
- useTour integrates with global window API

### Performance Considerations

- Ref-based pattern for high-frequency simulation updates
- Memoized computations for expensive calculations
- Controlled re-render patterns in hook design

### Testing Strategy

- Build verification for all changes
- Functional preservation verification
- Manual testing of extracted features

## Conclusion

The modularization project has successfully established a foundation for systematic extraction of business logic from the monolithic App.jsx component. While full integration remains to be completed, the architectural patterns and initial hook implementations provide a clear path forward for continued refactoring.

The project demonstrates the feasibility of modularizing complex React applications while maintaining system stability and functionality. The extracted tour and panel management systems are fully functional, proving the effectiveness of the approach.
