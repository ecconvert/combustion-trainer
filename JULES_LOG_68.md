# Summary of Work for Issue #68: Fuel Selector

This document outlines the steps taken by Jules, the AI software engineer, to address [Issue #68](https://github.com/ecconvert/combustion-trainer/issues/68).

## 1. Task Analysis
The initial task was to reconcile the state of the codebase with the feature request in Issue #68: "Add a fuel selector supporting gas and oil; integrate with chemistry module." The guiding principle was to treat the codebase as the source of truth.

## 2. Code Exploration
A thorough exploration of the codebase was conducted to determine if the feature was already implemented.
- **`src/lib/fuels.js`**: This file was found to contain definitions for multiple fuel types, including "Natural Gas", "Propane" (gases), and "Fuel Oil #2", "Biodiesel" (oils). This confirmed the necessary data was present.
- **`src/lib/chemistry.js`**: The `computeCombustion` function in this module was found to accept a `fuel` object as a parameter, meaning the core logic was capable of handling different fuels.
- **`src/App.jsx`**: This file was identified as the main application component. Investigation revealed a React state variable `fuelKey` and a `<select>` dropdown menu that allowed users to choose from the fuels defined in `fuels.js`. The selected fuel was correctly passed to the `computeCombustion` function.

## 3. Conclusion
The exploration led to the conclusion that the feature described in Issue #68 was **already fully implemented** and functional.

## 4. Test Implementation
As per the operational instructions, when a feature is found to be implemented, the correct action is to add tests to verify its behavior.
- A new test file was created: `src/__tests__/fuel-selector.test.tsx`.
- A test case was written to:
    1. Render the application.
    2. Change the fuel selector to "Fuel Oil #2".
    3. Verify that UI elements (like the HHV display) updated correctly.
    4. Verify that the underlying chemistry calculations changed as a result, confirming the integration was working.

## 5. Testing and Verification
The test suite was run to validate the new test and check for regressions.
- **Result**: The newly created `fuel-selector.test.tsx` passed successfully.
- **Note**: It was observed that the test suite had 9 pre-existing, unrelated failures. These were deemed out of scope for the current task.

## 6. User Intervention and Re-Verification
The user informed me of a recent commit to the `main` branch that might have fixed the failing tests. To ensure my work was based on the latest code:
1. The local workspace was reset to pull the latest changes from `main`.
2. The new test file (`src/__tests__/fuel-selector.test.tsx`) was re-created.
3. The test suite was run again. The result was the same: my new test passed, and the 9 unrelated tests continued to fail.

## 7. Submission
With the feature verified as implemented and a passing test case created, a pull request was submitted to add the test coverage to the codebase. The pull request description includes a summary of these findings and a `Closes #68` keyword to automatically close the issue upon merging.
